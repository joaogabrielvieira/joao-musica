Is this thing on? Word

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just havin' fun
We don't care who sees (shit)
So what we go out? (Ayy, lemme get a lighter, please?)
That's how it's supposed to be ('cause you know I'm high as fuck and I forgot one)
Livin' young and wild and free (keep that in there)

So what I keep 'em rolled up?
Saggin' my pants, not carin' what I show
Keep it real with my niggas, keep it player for these hoes
It look clean, don't it? Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I'm with your bitch smokin' grade A

You know what?
It's like I'm seventeen again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin', on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh, my God, I'm on the chase
Chevy, it's gettin' kinda heavy
Relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keeps slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Upfront, four blunts, like: Khalifa, put the weed in a J

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just havin' fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Livin' young and wild and free

Uh, and I don't even care
'Cause if me and my team in there, there's gon' be some weed in the air
Tell 'em, Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter, so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down, find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang, uh

Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll and live off life

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just havin' fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Livin' young and wild and free

Yeah, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this, you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one
And we all just havin' fun

So we just roll one, smoke one
When you live like this, you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one
And we all just havin' fun

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just havin' fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Livin' young and wild and free
