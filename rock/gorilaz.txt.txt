City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
You've got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they've got to kiss me, 'cause I don't get sleep, no

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever, hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love is freely
Turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Laughin' gas, these hazmats, fast cats
Linin' em up like ass cracks
Play these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here
Care Bear reppin' it harder this year
Watch me as I gravitate
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust
Can't fight with us
With yo' sound you kill the Inc
So don't stop, get it, get it (get it)
Until you're cheddar headed
And watch the way I navigate
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

Don't stop, get it, get it (sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca)
Peep how your captain's in it (feel good)
Steady, watch me navigate (sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca)
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha (feel good)
Don't stop, get it, get it (sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca)
